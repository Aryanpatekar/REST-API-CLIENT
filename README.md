A REST API client in Java is a software utility or application that communicates with RESTful web services to send and receive data over HTTP. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications, and Java provides multiple ways to create and consume REST APIs. The primary purpose of a REST API client is to interact with web services by making HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to exchange data in formats like JSON or XML. Java offers several libraries for building REST API clients, including HttpURLConnection, Apache HttpClient, OkHttp, and Java 11’s HttpClient. One of the most widely used libraries for RESTful web service communication is JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services), which provides standard annotations and tools for handling HTTP requests and responses. Another popular option is Spring Boot’s RestTemplate and WebClient, which simplify API consumption with built-in methods for request handling and response processing. The REST API client typically sends an HTTP request to a server, retrieves the response, and processes the returned data accordingly. It can handle authentication mechanisms such as Basic Authentication, OAuth, and API tokens to ensure secure communication.
